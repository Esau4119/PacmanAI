What problems did you encounter? How did you overcome them?
	- Given how little I knew about python, one of the main issues was battleing syntax errors. I tried to practice different techiques that would 
		challenge me using python. This helped improve my overall understanding of the language. Another issue was at the start, dealing with building 
		the first search algorithm. I was heavliy confused on what data we were given. We were guided toward the search agents file, but it was a tab it overwhelming 
		to read and understand fully. 

Did anything surprise you? What did you learn from it?
	- What really surpized me was how similar the algorithms are. It was all basically the same base structure with some small rules that we needed
		to implement. 
Can you explain why your heuristics for Q6 and Q7 are admissible and consistent?
	- The heuristics are admissible because they are less that the full cost toward any of our goals.
		They remain this way through out the whole game, making the heuristics consistent.
