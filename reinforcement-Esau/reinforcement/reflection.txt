What problems did you encounter? How did you overcome them?
-After assignments 0-3, I am a lot more comfortable with python. So the number of issues was reduced heavily. 
Did anything surprise you? What did you learn from it?
	- Question 2 was the most surpizing given how we learned to set values for our policies. These projects are challenging and help us 
		extend our coding knowledge. 
Describe what thought went into your answers to question 2. Are there any other settings of parameters that may also have worked?
	- I am certain that there are other parameters that could have worked. These numbers have appeared through a series of trial and error.
	They are tailored to the specifics of each question.
